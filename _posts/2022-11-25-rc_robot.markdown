So all of this started when I filed my first patent. This blog has nothing to _do_ with said patent, beyond it being ultimately part of a version 4 prototype, but this ridulous thing wouldn't exist without the patent. 

What exact was started, and what can it do? Feel free to look below and award internet points as apporpriate. 


What is it? How did I do it? How many things did I fry in the process of making it? (Hint: too damn many). These and all your other questions will be answered after the break.
