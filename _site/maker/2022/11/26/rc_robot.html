  <h1>Making an RC Vaccum</h1>

  <p>So all of this started when I filed my first patent. This blog has nothing to <em>do</em> with said patent, beyond it being ultimately part of a version 4 prototype, but this ridulous thing wouldn’t exist without the patent.</p>

<p>What exact was started, and what can it do? Feel free to look below and award internet points as apporpriate.</p>

<p>What is it? How did I do it? How many things did I fry in the process of making it? (Hint: too damn many). These and all your other questions will be answered after the break.</p>
